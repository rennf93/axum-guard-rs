# API reference

The public surface of `axum_guard_rs` `1.0.0`. The full crate documentation
is also in `src/lib.rs` (build it with `cargo doc --open`). Most behavior is
defined by [tower-guard-rs](https://github.com/rennf93/tower-guard-rs) and
re-exported here.

## Guard layer

### `with_guard`

```rust
use axum::Router;
use axum_guard_rs::{DetectConfig, with_guard};

let config = DetectConfig {
    max_content_length: 10_000,
    max_full_scan_bytes: 262_144,
    preserve_attack_patterns: true,
    semantic_threshold: 0.7,
    threat_score_threshold: 1.0,
};

let app: Router = Router::new().layer(with_guard(config));
```

`with_guard(config: DetectConfig) -> GuardLayer` builds the Guard layer for
an axum `Router`. Apply it with `Router::layer` (every registered route) or
`Router::route_layer` (routes only, skipping the fallback). Chain
`GuardLayer::with_body_cap` to change the body buffering cap:

```rust
let layer = axum_guard_rs::with_guard(axum_guard_rs::default_config())
    .with_body_cap(1_048_576);
let app = Router::new().layer(layer);
```

A body larger than the cap is rejected with `413 Payload Too Large` rather
than forwarded unscanned. A cap of `0` rejects every request that carries a
non-empty body.

## The IP gate: `with_ip_gate` + `client_ip_layer`

The global IP gate from `tower-guard-rs`: `whitelist`, `blacklist`, and
`exempt_ips`, parsed once at construction (invalid entry is a config error,
fail closed) and evaluated before detection:

```rust
use axum_guard_rs::{IpGateConfig, client_ip_layer, default_config, with_guard};

let gate = IpGateConfig::new(
    [] as [&str; 0],
    ["203.0.113.9"],
    ["198.51.100.7", "198.51.100.16/28"],
)
.expect("valid lists");

let app: Router = Router::new()
    .layer(with_guard(default_config()).with_ip_gate(gate))
    .layer(client_ip_layer());
```

A blacklisted IP, or an IP a non-empty `whitelist` matches neither directly
nor through `exempt_ips`, is denied with `403 Forbidden` (`Forbidden` body)
before detection. `client_ip_layer()` copies axum's
`ConnectInfo<SocketAddr>` (present when the router is served with
`into_make_service_with_connect_info::<SocketAddr>()`) into the
`GuardClientIp` extension the gate reads; apply it **after** the guard layer
(axum runs the last-added layer first). Requests without connect info are not
attributed: the gate does not run and detection still screens them.

**exempt_ips vs whitelist.** `exempt_ips` is noise reduction for
known-friendly automation (monitoring probes, VPN egress, a partner's
server), not immunity: it sets the same skip state a whitelist match sets
(`IpGateDecision` in the request extensions) but never adds a deny path and
never opens the whitelist gate. The blacklist, bans-style checks, and
detection still apply to exempt IPs - an attack payload from an exempt IP is
still `403 Suspicious activity detected`. The Rust family ships no rate
limiter, user-agent filter, cloud-provider blocker, or violation counter yet;
a stage that lands later must skip exactly what the reference skips for a
whitelist match and never skip detection.

## Configuration

### `default_config()`

Returns the reference default `DetectConfig`:

| Knob | Value |
|---|---|
| `max_content_length` | `10_000` |
| `max_full_scan_bytes` | `262_144` |
| `preserve_attack_patterns` | `true` |
| `semantic_threshold` | `0.7` |
| `threat_score_threshold` | `1.0` |

### `DetectConfig`

Re-exported from the engine (via `tower-guard-rs`). Fields:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `max_content_length` | `usize` | Semantic budget and truncation budget |
| `max_full_scan_bytes` | `usize` | Preprocessor full-scan cap (also the default body cap) |
| `preserve_attack_patterns` | `bool` | Keep attack patterns in the processed view |
| `semantic_threshold` | `f64` | Semantic analysis threshold |
| `threat_score_threshold` | `f64` | Threat score threshold for a verdict |

## Re-exports

From `tower-guard-rs`:

| Item | Kind |
|---|---|
| `GuardLayer` | The tower layer `with_guard` returns |
| `GuardService` | The tower service the layer produces |
| `GuardBody` | Body wrapper the service answers with |
| `BoxError` | Boxed error type used by the guard body |
| `default_config` | Reference default `DetectConfig` |
| `DetectConfig`, `DetectVerdict`, `Threat` | Engine types from `guard_core_engine::detect` |
| `BLOCKED_MESSAGE`, `OVERSIZE_MESSAGE`, `FAILURE_MESSAGE`, `FORBIDDEN_MESSAGE` | Refusal message bodies (`"Suspicious activity detected"`, `"Payload too large"`, `"Security check failed"`, `"Forbidden"`) |
| `GuardClientIp` | Extension type the IP gate reads the client IP from |
| `IpGateConfig`, `IpGateDecision`, `IpGateDenial`, `IpGateError`, `IpGateVerdict` | Engine types from `guard_core_engine::ip_gate` |

## Behavior

### What it inspects

One engine call per request view:

| Request part | Engine context | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Path | `url_path` | Skipped for `/` |
| Query string | `query_param` | Skipped when empty |
| Header values | `header` | Skips `sec-*` and the negotiation/routing headers |
| Body | `request_body` | Buffered first, capped |

The HTTP method is not scanned.

### Responses

| Situation | Status | Body |
|---|---|---|
| Engine flags a view | `403 Forbidden` | `Suspicious activity detected` |
| Body exceeds the cap | `413 Payload Too Large` | `Payload too large` |
| Body read error or engine panic | `500 Internal Server Error` | `Security check failed` |

The adapter is fail-secure: any failure to complete the security check
answers `500`, never an uninspected passthrough. Engine panics are caught
with `catch_unwind` (note that `panic = "abort"` in a release profile
disables that recovery).
